# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

Received the starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee data.
This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript that I wrote.


## Tasks Completed

- When clicking the "Add employee button" a prompt pops up asking for first name, last name, and salary
- When the employee's information is filled out, you can continue or cancel
- Created a function with a 'while' loop that allows users to add multiple employee information
- Created a function that will take the generated array of employees and log the average salary and number of employees to the console
- Created a function that will take in the generated array of employees, randomly selected one emplyee (using the Math.random object), and used a template literal to log their full name to the console
